TRIPLE-S will pay $3.5 million and will adopt a robust corrective action plan to correct deficiencies in its HIPAA compliance program, an effort it has already begun.\n\n“OCR remains committed to strong enforcement of the HIPAA Rules,” said OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels. “This case sends an important message for HIPAA Covered Entities not only about compliance with the requirements of the Security Rule, including risk analysis, but compliance with the requirements of the Privacy Rule, including those addressing business associate agreements and the minimum necessary use of protected health information.”\n\nTRIPLE-S is an insurance holding company based in San Juan, Puerto Rico, which offers a wide range of insurance products and services to residents of Puerto Rico through its subsidiaries.  TRIPLE-S has fully cooperated with HHS in investigating this case and has agreed to put in place a comprehensive HIPAA compliance program as a condition for settlement.  \n\nAfter receiving multiple breach notifications from TRIPLE-S involving unsecured protected health information (PHI), OCR initiated investigations to ascertain the entities’ compliance with HIPAA Rules. OCR’s investigations indicated widespread non-compliance throughout the various subsidiaries of Triple-S, including:\n\nFailure to implement appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the privacy of its beneficiaries’ PHI;\nImpermissible disclosure of its beneficiaries’ PHI to an outside vendor with which it did not have an appropriate business associate agreement;\nUse or Disclosure of more PHI than was necessary to carry out mailings;\nFailure to conduct an accurate and thorough risk analysis that incorporates all IT equipment, applications, and data systems utilizing ePHI; and\nFailure to implement security measures sufficient to reduce the risks and vulnerabilities to its ePHI to a reasonable and appropriate level.\nThe settlement requires TRIPLE-S to establish a comprehensive compliance program designed to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the personal information it collects from its beneficiaries, that includes:\n\nA risk analysis and a risk management plan;\nA process to evaluate and address any environmental or operational changes that affect the security of the ePHI it holds;\nPolicies and procedures to facilitate compliance with requirements of the HIPAA Rules; and\nA training program covering the requirements of the Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules, intended to be used for all members of the workforce and business associates providing services on TRIPLE-S premises."

OCR received two other breach reports from the CE which involved the same or similar fact patterns as the breach report for this case.  OCR consolidated these investigations into one breach compliance review.  The CE investigated the breaches and concluded that the likelihood of misuse or further disclosure of the PHI was remote since the USPS confirmed that all unmatched pages were segregated and shredded.  The CE provided breach notification to HHS, affected individuals, and notified appropriate authorities required by each jurisdiction that included an affected individual.  The CE also offered affected individuals a free two-year subscription to credit monitoring services and credit report controls.  Following the breach, the CE appointed a new privacy officer, who was required to complete HIPAA training, and verified that its workforce received HIPAA-related training.  The CE also implemented a new breach reporting procedure and initiated the implementation of a secure online portal for clients to obtain PHI electronically.

Following an investigation by OCR, the practice submitted a breach notification to HHS on September 16, 2015, in which it reported that the PHI of approximately 2,075 patients was potentially viewable online, including addresses, dates of birth, names, and clinical information.  In response to the incident, the CE contacted its electronic medical record (“EMR”) hosting company, IOS Health Systems (“IOS”), which immediately secured the information and conducted an internal investigation.  IOS changed the file locations of the practice’s EMR records, renamed the file structures, obfuscated file directories, conducted standard security inspections, and began an audit trail review to determine any unauthorized access to the CE's records.  Additionally, the CE ensured that users did not share any documents or links via non-secure methods, changed all passwords for all users, confirmed username and password confidentiality policies with all employees, ensured proper antivirus and spyware applications were installed, and verified that its firewall was properly configured with the latest version of security upgrades.  In response to OCR’s investigation, the practice provided evidence that provided breach notification to HHS, affected individuals and the media, and offered identity theft protection services.  It also terminated its relationship with its EMR system hosting company, IOS, and entered into a revised business associate agreement with a new EMR hosting company.

The CE “blacklisted” these IP addresses as the investigation continued in order to allow the firewall to block any attempts to access the electronic health record program through the remote desktop protocol.  The forensics firm also identified fifteen suspicious local accounts and three administration accounts that were potentially compromised.  The CE provided breach notification to HHS, affected individuals, and the media, and posted substitute notice in accordance with the Breach Notification Rule.  OCR provided technical assistance regarding the CE’s obligations to conduct a comprehensive and current security risk analysis and implement a corresponding risk management/mitigation plan to address any findings.
